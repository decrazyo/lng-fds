For info how to build and move boot.atari and lunix.atari to Atari read info in
devel_utils/atari/README.
Now you can only build kernel, no modules support, no binaries support (you don't
have possiblility to load them anyway).

This is the first attempt at porting LUnix to Atari. After two days of research
and coding I have running system, console, keyboard and microshell.
There are still things to be corrected/improved, like:

- kernel/fs.s   - remove fs_iec from there if Atari present
- default colors are ugly (see kernel/opt/antic_console_init.s for change)
- possibly detect computer type 65/800/130 and processor 6502/6502c
    code is here:

    ;; returns 0 for 6502c and 1 for 6502/6510/8502
    ;; tmpzp on zero page!
    lda #1
    sta tmzp
    .byte 100, tmpzp		; stz tmpzp (STore Zero) or two byte NOP
    rts

- kernel/atari/calib.s - no real calibration is done, I have made up the values :)
- kernel/atari/irqinit.s - there's no TOD, nor timer2 initialization
- kernel/atari/keyboard.s - some gfx characters could be used for unavailable ASCII like ` is
    upper left square on atari (CTRL+L)
- opt/antic_console{_init}.s - there's no MULTIPLE_CONSOLES support
- kernel/atari/tasksw.s - there's no timer2 available, nor alarm so some values are left
    behind

and all in all
- there's no disk support, no rs232 support
