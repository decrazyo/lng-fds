transfer lng.c64 to your Commodore64, insert a empty (formatted) disk
in drive 8 and run it, it will create a (hopefully :) working
LUnix disk

Run LUnix by loading "loader",8 + run

If this doe not work (maybe, because you want to use a different
set of boot.c64/lunix.c64 files) try it by hand:

load "boot.c64",8,1
...
load "lunix.c64",8,1
...
sys 4096
