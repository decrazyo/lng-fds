luna, lupo, lld
 are assembler, preprocessor and linker needed to build lunix
 (i decided to include them in here, because of the changes i made
 to the tools in order to work with the new version of lunix)

relate
 is a simple tool (not tested much) to lookup function dependencies
 (go into the kernel subdirectory and do "relate *.s")

chklib, chkobj
 tools to check the object (or library) created with luna/lld
