The proper way to build Atari bootdisk you should go back to top level directory
and do:
  make devel
  make
  make package
Then you will have binatari/ directory with 'atari.bin' file that can be loaded
and executed from Atari DOS and pkg/ directory with a bootable Atari disk image.
As an alternative you can use make.sh script from this directory to build a disk
image with MyDOS.

Some tools from Internet that I have gathered here:

femul-1.4.c	- every Atari poweruser knows what's that for :) (find in source
		  code the port ttyS[0-4] and change it to correct one before
		  compiling)

unix2atr-0.9.c	- I use it to move atari.bin to a disk image so I can load it
		  on Real Machine (tm) from DOS

binload-2.5.c	- Atari binary format analyzer

atr2unix-1.2.c	- for getting files out of .atr

makeimage.c	- to make atari.bin file out of boot.atari and lunix.atari

dos25/		- DOS.SYS, DUP.SYS
mydos/		- DOS.SYS, DUP.SYS (actually, working)
