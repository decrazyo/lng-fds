transfer lng.c128 to your Commodore128, insert a empty (formatted) disk
in drive 8 and run it (in C64 mode!), it will create a (hopefully :) working
LUnix disk.

Run LUnix by loading "loader",8 + run

If you want to use a different
set of boot.c128/lunix.c128 files, you may want to load them by hand:

bload "boot.c128"
...
bload "lunix.c128"
...
sysdec("1300") 

You may also alter the boot block by running autoboot. LUnix
will then autoboot from floppy.
