note to self: RELEASE PROCEDURE
- change version number in bootstrap.s, system.h
- for IDE64: packages and .lunixrc (with ide64rtc) and ide64loader onto disk image
- for C64/128: make cbmdisc

my to-do list:
-- environment for a working "more" command (partly done)
-- driver for UP9600 (enhanced userport rs232 interface)
-- driver for 16550 based RS232 interfaces
-- RAM disc for REU
-- general support for external RAM
-- environment for "ps" with command names
-- better vt100/ansi emulation
-- better handling of lines longer than 40 chars
-- shell command completion (from history buffer ?)
-- shell wildcard expansion
-- command cache
-- move parts of the kernel into a library
-- distribute lunix in a >compressed< archive

ytm todo:
- need to check if atari/pcat keyboard weren't broken during last change
- rewrite fs stuff to support block I/O (fread and fwrite)
  e.g. for IEC: enter_atomic, load up to 254 bytes and leave_atomic;
  for IDE64: enter ROM compatible mode, load WHOLE block, leave ROM mode
- support for external RAM in similar way to cc65 .emd drivers

from groepaz:
- added fasthead util and alternative loader for it. this should
  probably merged into one program that sends the floppy command
  and then loads lunix.

- sh:command-line argument support for scripts
- sh:improve piping... '!' with more than two programs,
  '>' and '<' ...
- "less" program?
- "test", "if", "switch", "read" programs? (what else is
   required for simple scripting jobs? :o))
- "strmkill" program?
- some kind of "sed" and "killall"/"shutdown"/"reboot" scripts
- some kind of "grep"
- simple texteditor
- silversurfer supports baudrates up to 230kbaud, this
  driver will only go up to 57600 by now.
- silversurfer hack shouldnt be a compiletime option...
  better make some commandline switches or sth
