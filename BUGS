(to-fix-list)
- Mixed TCP/ICMP traffic sometimes causes the machine to hang

- on C128 PPP is buggy and SLIP doesn't work at all - are ppp,slip,tcpip
  free from c64-specific code? does mmu_stack matter?

- bug in atari tasksw.s - lk_timer stuff should be affected _only_ if IRQ source was timer,
  now it is decremented on both timer and keyboard interrupts
  fix is obvious but I want to test it on a real machine

- rs232std seems not to operate well with the TCP/IP code

- ftp sometimes has problems with longer file names, it seems to
  download the file but in fact doesn't save the received data to disc

- parent process' environment PWD is not changed with cd tool

- hangs on atari 130xe due to PIA init

- lunixrc is only on disk image, not in package release

- sh treats whitespace on the left side as part of the command name
