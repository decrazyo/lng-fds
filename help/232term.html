usage: 232term

<p>232term is a very simple terminal program. Like 232echo it asks
for a baudrate at the commandline and then enters operative state.
Key strokes are sent to the serial interface, received characters
are displayed on the screen. 232term can be used to log into a
remote host (eg. your ISP). Press CTRL+D to leave 232term.</p>
