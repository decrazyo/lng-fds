<title>buf</title>

Usage: buf

<p>Buf is a quite simple application. Buf reads from standard input
and tries to keep everything in memory until EOF (end of file).
After receiving an EOF buf prints all data from memory to standard
output.</p>

<p>I used buf to receive text pasted into an LNG window when
running a remote session (telnet from my PC to LNG), because it
showed up that pasting directly into an LNG file (using "tee")
degraded TCP/IP performance a lot. I suggest to use "buf!tee"
instead.</p>

<p>An other example: "cat file1!buf!tee file2" is usually faster
than "cp file1 file2" but doesn't work for huge files.</p>
