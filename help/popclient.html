usage: popclient configname [savefile]

<p>The popclient application can be used to communicate with another
host using the Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) as defined in
RFC1939. POP3 is used to retrieve and manipulate a remote eMail folder.</p>
<p>The configuration is stored in a file with the configname extended 
by ".p3". The format of the configuration file is
shown in the following example:</p>
<p>
 192.168.0.33  # address of server<br>
 dumbo # login used on this server<br>
 4711  # password
</p>
<p>The IPaddrss of the server must be known in digits! Popclient accepts
the name of an optional savefile at the commandline. If a savefile
is specified the "get" command can be used to retrieve eMails that are 
stored in a local file (savefile).</p>
