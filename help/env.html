Usage: env [VARIABLE[=value]]

<p>Env prints the environment settings as they are inherited from
the parent process (the shell you used to invoke env). There are
always following environment variables:</p>

<p>current working device</p>

<p>Default device for loading/saving files (major: 2=floppy, minor:
8=drive with secondary address 8)</p>

<p>terminal width</p>

<p>Width of the used output terminal. This information is used by
applications like "more", that need to know the size of the visible
screen.</p>

<p>When called with VARIABLE it will show value of that variable in
parent process.</p>

<p>When called with VARIABLE=value (w/o spaces) it will assign value
to given variable in parent process. If value is empty then variable
in parent process will be deleted.</p>
