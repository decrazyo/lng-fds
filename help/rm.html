Usage: rm [-i] file... 

<p>Remove files. Wildcards are not supported explicitely -
wildcards have to be expanded by the shell anyway :)</p>

<p>In spite of that, be careful with special chars like "*" "," "?"
"@" since these might be interpreted by the CBM bios (rm issues a
open x,dev,15,"s:file" command)</p>

<p>Options:</p>
<p>-i  Prompt before any removal</p>
