<title>Sh</title>
<body>
Usage: sh

<p>Sh is the standard command shell for LUnix. The shell reads
from standard input and interprets the incoming stream line
wise.</p>

<p>
Input format:<br>
command [parm1 [parm2 ... ]<br>
Command is either a builtin command or matches the name of
a executable that can be found in the current directory/drive.
</p>

<p>
Builtin features and commands:<br>
exit - exit the current shell<br>
Prints a warning message if there are running child processes left.
Calling exit a second time (or pressing CTRL+d) overrides the
waring message and forces the shell to exit immediately.
</p>

<p>
History feature:<br>
The shell has a 256 byte buffer to store old commandlines. By pressing
the cursor up and down keys you can browse through the old commandlines.
Such a recovered old commandline can be activated, edited just if it
was typed in manually. The history function only stores a commandline,
if it is different from the last one remembered.
</p>

<p>
Command completion:<br>
A way to search the buffered commandlines. Just type the first few 
characters, than press TAB (commodore key). The shell will try to
guess the command or argument by comparing the given charcters to
the commandline history. If a unique match (even a partly match) is
found, the command will be competed to that extend. If no match
is found, nothing happens.
