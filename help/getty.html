usage: getty baudrate

<p>Lets you connect a serial terminal to your LNG system and use
the system like sitting directly at the console. All keys pressed
at the terminal are passed to the shell, results are sent back to
the terminal. getty relies on the slightly obsolete SERv1 API and
will be replace by a newer program soon. (interoperates with
"sswiftlink", "srs232std")</p>
